# CampusNavigator

Before starting, you need to set up Android/IOS Environment in your Machine. [You can follow this guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 

After the environment is set-up, you may need to intall react-native globally. Install it using this command.

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Now, extract this project in your machine.

Open the project folder in any of the text editor.

Now, you will need to install the node modules the project needs.

To install the node modules, run this command in your project directory:

```
npm install
```
Now, you need to build the app in emulator. To do this, run this command in your project folder:

  ```
  npx react-native run-android
  
  ```
  If this gives some error, use this command
  
  ```
  npx react-native run-android --no-jetifier
  
  ```
  
  After the app is successfully build, open new terminal and change directory to project directory.
  We need to start this project in our emulator. Open the app in your emulator and run this command:
  ```
  npx react-native start
  
  ```
